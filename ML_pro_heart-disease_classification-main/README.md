# Heart Disease Classification using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors

This project provides an implementation of three different classification models, namely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for the task of heart disease classification. The goal of this project is to compare the performance of these models in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
